# tir2joy

This is an old project of mine which I understand is still being used here and there. 
As I no longer support the project, I have been asked to release the source code.

This repository includes all original project files. The original [readme.html](readme.html) is included.

The referenced PPJoy project can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/elitak/PPJoy).

## What is it?

vJoy is a tool that can map [TrackIR](https://www.trackir.eu) head movements to movements of a virtual joystick.
It can be used to control games via head movements that don't work directly with a TrackIR device.

## Where can I get support?

I'm afraid you can't get support from me. If you have any problems with the code or binary, you are on your own.

If someone is willing to take over this project, please feel free to do so.
